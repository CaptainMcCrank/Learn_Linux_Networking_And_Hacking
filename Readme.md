# Learn Linux Networking & Hacking
by Patrick McCanna

## Overview
I created this firmware image to teach my daughter the basic hacking skills that can give her a reasonably profitable shot at revenue.
Hopefully she never needs to use this :D

This firmware recipe 

1. turns your pi into a wifi hotspot
2. exposes an ssh server
3. exposes a web server that can be used to publish your first private web page.
4. exposes a web server that can be used to host vulnerable web apps for CTF testing
5. exposes a web server that can be used to show you what a server admin can see when you're browsing their site.
