You should research the names of the services you’ve discovered. These are all the ways we can gain access to a system without needing physical access to it.  The \u0026ldquo;Threat Surface\u0026rdquo; is the list of all possible entry points into a system.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\u0022attaching-to-an-http-entry-point\u0022\u003eAttaching to an http entry point\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to use the correct client to attach to an entry point.

You can use the ip address of the system, plus the port number to attach.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an http session, you would connect to http:\/\/[Default Gateway IP]:[Port Number].  E.g. http:\/\/10.10.10.1:80\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHTTPS sessions are typically hosted on port 443.

Clever sysadmins can host any service they want on a port.  This means that service listening on port 80 may not be an http server.  You can only confirm this by connecting to it with the correct client.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\u0022attaching-to-an-ssh-entry-point\u0022\u003eAttaching to an ssh entry point\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHackers identify all opportunities to tamper with data processed by a targeted asset.  Hackers find services that are \u0026ldquo;listening\u0026rdquo; for packets.  A listening service will accept packets sent by a hacker.  If you find listening services, you\u0026rsquo;ve found a potential entry point.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, we can get by with  basic techniques like guessing user accounts and passwords.  Secure systems use sophisticated authentication that makes guessing or stealing a credential impossible.  For those systems, we must explore more advanced techniques. This challenge is easy enough that we won\u0026rsquo;t worry about that approach for now.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a mobile device, you can use the \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/apps.applecom\/us\/app\/prompt-2\/id917437289\u0022\u003eprompt app\u003c\/a\u003e to ssh into a system.

These are the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The IETF publishes documents called Requests for Comments (RFCs). The RFCs are written by communities of engineers who collaborate to define the design of a protocol. They articulate how various things on the internet should work. This material is then used as a guide by software developers who implement the code that should produce various experiences. Reading an RFC can tell you how things are supposed to work. But the only way to know for sure how a certain program ACTUALLY works is to look at it’s code. Luckily, you do not need to learn to code to get started.
