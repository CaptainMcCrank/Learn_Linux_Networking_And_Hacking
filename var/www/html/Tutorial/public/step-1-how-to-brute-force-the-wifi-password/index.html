<ol>
<li>Make sure you have downloaded and installed the firmware onto an SDCard and installed the SDCard into your pi .</li>
<li>Make sure that when you power up the pi, you see a solid red power light and occasional blinking green lights.</li>
<li>Make sure you have both a mobile phone and a Mac laptop.  DO NOT PERFORM THIS WORK ON A CORPORATE OR MANAGED LAPTOP.  As we work through future labs, you will use tools that might get flagged as &ldquo;hacking tools&rdquo; by device management teams.  You should only perform this work on a computer you own.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="discoverying-the-wifi-network">Discoverying the Wifi Network</h1>
<p>The Raspberry Pi will operate as a wifi access point that you can practice hacking against.  About a minute after it is powered on, it will broadcast a wifi network with the name üåπ‚ò†Ô∏èüåπ.   You should find it from your mobile phone.  If you are using an iOS device, it would be under settings-&gt;wifi.</p>

<h1 id="manually-guessing-a-password">Manually guessing a password</h1>
<p>The üåπ‚ò†Ô∏èüåπ network is the one we&rsquo;ll be targeting.  So now you can try guessing some passwords if you&rsquo;d like.  You should find that unless you&rsquo;re really lucky, you won&rsquo;t be able to guess it.  You might want to read <a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/password-strength/">this post on password strength</a> for an understanding of just how many possible passwords could be used on the device.  Password guessing is not a good strategy- and neither is raw brute forcing, but perhaps there&rsquo;s an in-between approach.</p>
<p>People generally prefer to use passwords that are Memorable.  If you can&rsquo;t remember your password, you can&rsquo;t prove that you&rsquo;re the person who should be allowed to access the device.  Since people generally use memorable passwords, it stands to reason that the set of possible &ldquo;memorable&rdquo; passwords is significantly smaller than the total set of possible passwords.  If someone had a list of commonly used passwords, they might be able to speed up the process by trying those first before resorting to brute force.</p>

<h1 id="finding-a-dictionary">Finding a Dictionary</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to find a common password list.  You can do this by searching google for the following phrase:</p>
<p>&ldquo;10k most common passwords&rdquo;</p>
<p>you should see a link to a github repository show up that&rsquo;s at the following url:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt">https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt</a></p>
<p>Browse to the page.  Click on the button labeled &ldquo;raw&rdquo; on the right side of the page.  You can then save this file to your computer by clicking on the file menu for the browser and selecting &ldquo;save as.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="../saveasMedium.png" alt="alt text" title="saveas"></p>
<p>When you click on Save as, a dialog will show up:</p>
<p><img src="../saveas_dialogMedium.png" alt="alt text" title="Dialog"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to create a directory for starting our hacking.  You can do this from within the dialog by clicking on New Folder.  Name it HackingLab and click Create.</p>
<p><img src="../NewFolderMedium.png" alt="alt text" title="NewFolder"></p>
<p>Then go ahead and click on save.  You&rsquo;ll now have a file called &ldquo;10k-most-common.txt&rdquo; in the Hacking lab direcotry.  Let&rsquo;s learn to view the file from the command line.  Let&rsquo;s use spotlight to open up the terminal by hitting command and space simultaneously, and then typing in terminal:</p>
<p><img src="../SpotlightSearchTerminal_Small.png" alt="alt text" title="Terminal"></p>
<p>Change into your HackingLab directory by typing the following:</p>
<p><code>cd HackingLab</code>
Now that you&rsquo;re in the HackingLab directory, let&rsquo;s view the password file:</p>
<p><code>more 10k-most-common.txt</code></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that each row of the file contains a password.</p>
<p><img src="../moreLarge.png" alt="alt text" title="Terminal"></p>
<p>Hit <code>q</code> to leave the more command.</p>
<pre><code>- [x] Find the wifi network
- [x] Manually guess some passwords
- [x] Find a dictionary
- [ ] Find a command to use to connect to wifi networks 
- [ ] Figure out how to push the passwords from the dictionary file into the wifi connection command
- [ ] Launch the attack and Discover the credential
</code></pre>
<h1 id="finding-a-command-to-use-to-connect-to-wifi-networks">Finding a command to use to connect to wifi networks</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some passwords- now we need to figure out how to automate the connection attempts.  Let&rsquo;s do some google searching for &ldquo;Connect to wifi from command line mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found a posting here:
<a href="https://sharmank.medium.com/how-to-connect-to-wifi-using-mac-os-command-line-3a76c2e6669c">https://sharmank.medium.com/how-to-connect-to-wifi-using-mac-os-command-line-3a76c2e6669c</a></p>
<p>In it, they show two interesting commands:</p>
<p><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 &lt;SSID_OF_NETWORK&gt; &lt;PASSWORD&gt;</code></p>
<p>Try running the first command  (airport -s) from your mac.  On my machine, I find the command is sometimes unreliable and I need to run it multiple times, as you can see below:</p>
<p><img src="../airport_Medium.png" alt="alt text" title="Terminal"></p>
<p>In this command, you see a list of all the local wifi networks.  So we can confirm we see our target hacking environment.</p>
<p>Now we need to explore this networksetup command.  If you copy and paste it raw, you&rsquo;ll get an error, because it is expecting you to insert the ssid and the password into the command.  So if we wanted to try a single password against the device, we&rsquo;d need to do something like the following:</p>
<p><code>networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 üåπ‚ò†Ô∏èüåπ somepassword</code></p>
<p>(You can get an emoji keyboard by hitting the control+command+space keys simultaneously, and then you can search for skull or rose by typing in &ldquo;rose&rdquo; in the keyboard search:</p>
<p><img src="../emoji_Small.png" alt="alt text" title="Terminal"></p>
<p>When you run this command, you&rsquo;ll see that your wifi network will disconnect temporarily, and then there will be an error if you guessed the wrong password.  Alright- we found a command that can be used to connect to wifi networks- now we need to combine it with wour password list.</p>

<h1 id="pushing-passwords-from-dictionary-file-into-the-wifi-connection-cammand">Pushing passwords from dictionary file into the wifi connection cammand:</h1>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re going to do a little bash magic.</p>
<p>At the terminal, type the following lines in and hit enter at the end of each line:</p>
<p>while read passwordfilevalue; do</p>
<p>networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 üåπ‚ò†Ô∏èüåπ &ldquo;$passwordfilevalue&rdquo;</p>
<p>ifconfig en0 | grep inet</p>
<p>echo $passworfilevalue</p>

</table>
<p>So if we see an inet value return, we can see the password that worked.  In the gif below, you&rsquo;ll see a password which is not the password used on the full build, so you still have to go through the process yourself to hack the network. üòé</p>
