<li>What is the Wifi Password?</li>
<li>When you are connected to the network, what is default gateway ipaddress and hostname of the default gateway?  What is the IP address that was assigned to the device you were attached to?   What is the DNS server’s IP address while you’re connected to the hotspot?  (Need a clue?  check out this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZp7LNKHgk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZp7LNKHgk</a>)</li>
<li>Are you able to connect to the Internet over the hotspot in its default configuration?  How did you determine this?  Why does or doesn&rsquo;t it work?</li>
<li>What possible entry points exist for gaining access to the Hotspot?  Describe you tested to discover if the attack is possible?
How can you gain shell access to the device?  Do not continue to the next section until you have been able to gain access</li>
