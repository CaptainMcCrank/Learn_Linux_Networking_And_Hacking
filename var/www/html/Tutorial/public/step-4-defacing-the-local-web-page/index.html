    </header><p>Here are the commands you can use to change directory to <code>/var/www/html/</code>, make a backup of the <code>index.html</code> file, and modify the web page to update the <code>h3</code> tag:</p>
<ol>
<li>To change directory to <code>/var/www/html/</code>, use the <code>cd</code> command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>cd /var/www/html/</code></p>
<p>To check the filesystem permissions of /var/www/html/index.html on a Linux system, you can use the ls command with the -l option, which displays detailed information about the file, including its permissions.</p>
<p>For example, to check the permissions of /var/www/html/index.html, you can use the following command:</p>
<p><code>ls -l /var/www/html/index.html</code></p>
<p>This will display output similar to the following:</p>
<p>-rw-r&ndash;r&ndash; 1 root root 675 Jan 1 12:34 /var/www/html/index.html</p>
<p>The first column of the output shows the permissions for the file. In this example, the permissions are -rw-r&ndash;r&ndash;, which means that the owner of the file has read and write permissions (rw-), and others have read-only permissions (r&ndash;).</p>
<p>The second and third columns show the owner and group owner of the file, respectively. In this example, the owner is root and the group owner is also root.</p>
<p>The fourth column shows the size of the file in bytes. In this example, the size of /var/www/html/index.html is 675 bytes.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth columns show the date and time when the file was last modified. In this example, the file was last modified on January 1st at 12:34.</p>
<p>The final column shows the name of the file.</p>
<p>To find out what account you are currently using on a Linux system, you can use the whoami command. This command prints the current user&rsquo;s username to the terminal.</p>
<p><code>whoami</code></p>
<p>You can also use the id command to display more information about the current user, including the user&rsquo;s user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). For example:</p>
<p><code>id</code></p>
<p>uid=1000(jane) gid=1000(jane) groups=1000(jane),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),46(plugdev)</p>
<p>The uid and gid fields show the user&rsquo;s UID and GID, respectively. The groups field lists the user&rsquo;s supplementary groups.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To make a backup of the <code>index.html</code> file, use the <code>cp</code> command to copy the file to a new location:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>cp index.html index.html.bak</code></p>
<p>You will get a permissions error, because index.html is owned by root.</p>
<p>We need a way to overcome this.  Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a tool that can grant users temporary root privileges.  It&rsquo;s called sudo- and it only works if the account we&rsquo;re logged in as is part of the sudoer group.</p>
<p>To check if you are a member of the sudo group on a Linux system, you can use the groups command. This command displays the groups that the current user is a member of.</p>
<p>For example, to check if you are a member of the sudo group, you can run the following command:
<code>groups</code></p>
<p>This will display a list of the groups that you are a member of. If the sudo group is listed, then you are a member of the sudo group and have the ability to run commands with sudo.</p>
<p>You can also use the id command to check if you are a member of the sudo group. For example:</p>
<p><code>id -Gn | grep sudo</code></p>
<p>This will display the names of the groups that you are a member of, and the grep command will search the output for the string sudo. If the sudo group is listed, then you are a member of the sudo group.</p>
<p>if pi is a member of the sudo group, you can use the <code>sudo</code> command to run the command as root.</p>
<p><code>sudo cp index.html index.html.bak</code></p>
<p>This works because the user &ldquo;pi&rdquo; is part of the sudoer group</p>
<p>This creates a copy of <code>index.html</code> with the name <code>index.html.bak</code>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To modify the web page, you can use a text editor such as <code>nano</code> or <code>vi</code>. For example, to open the <code>index.html</code> file in <code>nano</code>, you can use the following command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>nano index.html</code></p>
<p>Use the arrow keys to navigate to the <code>h3</code> tag, and update the text between the opening and closing tags to say &ldquo;Elena was here!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To save your changes and exit <code>nano</code>, press <code>Ctrl + X</code>, then press <code>Y</code> to confirm that you want to save the changes, and finally press <code>Enter</code>.</p>
