## Scanning

The first goal of many hackers is to identify the entry points into a system.  This can be achieved using network reconnisance tools to "scan" a host.

Scanning can be performed with an iphone app called [Net Analyer](https://apps.apple.com/app/id557405467)
it also can be performed by installing and running an  app called 'nmap' on a laptop.

You should attempt to scan the ip address of the hotspot.  Can you figure out what the ip address is of the Hotspot?  here's a hint: it's the default gateway that your device will have when it's attached to the wifi network.  Perhaps there is a SETTING for the WIFI NETWORK which would give you a clue?
